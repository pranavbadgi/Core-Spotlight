# Core Data

Core Data is a Swift Project developed in Xcode 13. This is Part 1 of a multiple part project. 

How does this work?
The app consists of two view controllers, one shows the list of meetings and other is used to create the meetings. We are using Core data for data persistence. This is dummy way of getting meetings. In the real app the list of the meetings will be fetched from the API.

The next Part of the project includes - Integrating Core Spotlight to this CoreData project and indexing the meetings in the spotlight search to make it available system wide.
